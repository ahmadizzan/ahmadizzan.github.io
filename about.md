Hello! I'm Izzan ()

I'm currently working on machine learning at stealth startup in Singapore.

I'm a final-year computer science student at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/), Indonesia.

Previously I worked on machine intelligence at Google, system research at GIK Lab-UChicago, text summarization at ITB, image search at Bukalapak, and notification at Dekoruma.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies/tv series and listening to loud music.
