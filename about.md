Hi there, my name is Izzan.

I enjoy learning about tech advancements especially how it helps everyday's lives. More specifically, I'm fascinated by how data when properly sourced and processed could improve decision making and become the foundation of many applications on top of it.

I'm currently a final-year computer science student at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/).

Previously I worked on search at Stealth Startup, machine intelligence at [Google](https://www.google.com/), system research at [GIK Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/garudailmukomputer/)[-UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), text summarization at [ITB](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/), image search at [Bukalapak](https://www.bukalapak.com/), and notification at [Dekoruma](https://www.dekoruma.com/).

Favorite product: Twitter, Quora.
