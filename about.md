Hi there, my name is Izzan.

I enjoy learning about tech advancements especially how it helps everyday's lives. More specifically, I'm fascinated by how data when properly sourced and processed could improve decision making and become the foundation of many applications on top of it.

Previously I worked on search & product development at Stealth Startup, machine intelligence at [Google](https://www.google.com/), system research at [GIK Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/garudailmukomputer/)[-UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), text summarization at [ITB](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/), image search at [Bukalapak](https://www.bukalapak.com/), and notification at [Dekoruma](https://www.dekoruma.com/).

Studied computer science at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/), Indonesia.

Favorite product: Twitter, Quora.
