Hello! I'm Izzan.

I'm currently working on machine learning at a stealth startup in Singapore.

I'm a final-year computer science student at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/), Indonesia.

Previously I worked on machine intelligence at [Google](https://www.google.com/), system research at [GIK Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/garudailmukomputer/)[-UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), text summarization at [ITB](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/), image search at [Bukalapak](https://www.bukalapak.com/), and notification at [Dekoruma](https://www.dekoruma.com/).

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies/tv series and listening to loud music.
