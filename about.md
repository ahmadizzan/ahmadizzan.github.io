Hello! I'm Ahmad Izzan (Izzan), a computer science student undergrad at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/), Indonesia. I'm interested in tech field especially in machine learning and distributed system.

At the moment, I'm working with [Prof. Masayu Leylia Khodra](https://www.itb.ac.id/staff/view/masayu-leylia-khodra-sqe) of Bandung Institute of Technology on Natural Language Processing research in text summarization. At the same time, I'm working with [Prof. Haryadi Gunawi](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/) of University of Chicago on distributed system research in garbage collector in part of [GIK Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/garudailmukomputer/).

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies/tv series and listening to loud music.
