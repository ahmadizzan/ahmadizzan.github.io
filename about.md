Hello! I'm Ahmad Izzan (Izzan), a computer science student undergrad at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://if.stei.itb.ac.id/), Indonesia. I'm interested in tech field especially in machine learning and distributed system.

I'm fortunate enough to gain valuable experiences from my internships. Previously interned at Bukalapak as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern and Dekoruma as a Software Engineering Intern.

At the moment, I'm working with [Prof. Haryadi Gunawi](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/) of University of Chicago on distributed system research in garbage collector in part of [GIK Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/garudailmukomputer/).

Feel free to reach me at [aahmadizzan@gmail.com](mailto:aahmadizzan@gmail.com).

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies/tv series and listening to loud music. Currently 6 seasons deep into The Office!
