One of my goal this summer 2018 is to read more books! I'm trying to read at least 3 non-tech books.

**Done:**
- [What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6081261-what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-was-20)


**To read:**
- [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow)
- [Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12158480-why-nations-fail)
- [Principles: Life and Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles)
