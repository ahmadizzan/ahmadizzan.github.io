One of my goal this summer 2018 is to read more books! I'm trying to read at least 3 non-tech books.

**Done:**

- [Everything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I've Loved](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133923-everything-happens-for-a-reason?ac=1&from_search=true)
- [Flowers for Algernon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36576608-flowers-for-algernon)

**To read:**
- [Man's Search For Meaning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning?ac=1&from_search=true)
