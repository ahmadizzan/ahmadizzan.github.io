One of my goal this summer 2018 is to read more books! I'm trying to read at least 3 non-tech books.

**Done:**
- [What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6081261-what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-was-20)


**To read:**
- [Everything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I've Loved](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133923-everything-happens-for-a-reason?ac=1&from_search=true)
- [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow)
