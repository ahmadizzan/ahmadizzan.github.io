## Introduction
About a year have passed since I finished my first tech internship as a Software Engineering Intern, and looking back, it’s been a hell lot of experience happened to me in the last year. Inspired by my friend Satryaji and Albert post about their experiences in finding software engineering internship in their first-year of undergrad, I decided to write my own. Hope you will enjoy it!

## Why apply for tech internships?
Software engineering internships can be really exciting and invaluable experiences. Not only that you will get hands-on experience building real products that people actually used, you will also meet with amazing people who are just as passionate as you are in the technology field.

But, tech internships can also be daunting. If you are say a decorated olympiads in informatics, or already learned programming for a long time, you probably can get tech internship with ease. But if you are inexperienced in the field, just applying itself can be pretty scary (at least for me).

Back at the end of my first semester of my study at Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) at the School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, I pretty much felt the same thing. On one side I really wanted to apply to tech internships at the end of the school year, but on the other side I felt really undeserved and unprepared for it because not only that I still lack the skills, I almost got no relevant course in programming. I only know the basics of Pascal programming language which I got from Information Technology course, and I have read a little about C++ and JavaScript, but I know I’m still far from being good at it.

## Preparation
Knowing that I still know so little, I dedicated a lot of time on my second semester to study programming. After googling in my winter break, I listed down things I believe I should learn in my second semester to be applicable enough for internships. From what I got, I need to learn Algorithms and Data Structures and make Side Projects. Side projects are really important for me because as someone with no achievement in computer science field and almost no relevant course in programming, I got nothing to show in my resume. Algorithms and data structures, too, is important because from what I read, many tech companies internship interview test problem solving skills on algorithms and data structures problems. This is pretty hard because I only got the course on my 3rd semester which means that I have to learn it by my own.

What I did to basically learn as much as I can is creating a 10-week sprint of code which for 10 weeks, 6 days a week, atleast 3 hours per day (sometimes more), I dedicated my time to learn programming. I started out by buying NodeJS course on Udemy (which I bought on sale for about 15$). I also try to learn some popular algorithms and data structures by watching explanation on youtube (mycodeschool ftw), trying to implement them in C++, and also doing some exercises on Hackerrank. Although still not proficient, I manage to pick up some key topics such stack, queue, tree, linked-list, graph, and many more. I also try to do some problems on Codeforces to sharpen my problem solving skills.

After finishing my NodeJS course on Udemy, I try to create side-projects by my own. I try to create not just a project to show, but a project that I actually use. One of the project that I create was a LINE bot that can fetch lectures schedule and codeforces contests and ratings, which I use almost everyday. I also put all my work on github, which also make me learn a thing or two about git, something that I really really recommend you to learn before you do your first internships.

After 10 weeks, I can finally create a gdocs-template-with-big-font-size-also-big-line-spacing-so-that-it-fits-a-full-page resume, and then I started applying for software engineering internships. yay!.

## Applying for internships
Having no connection in the field, I rely mostly from google searches, tech news, and LinkedIn to find companies to apply internships to. I finally listed down companies that I wanted to apply to for Software Engineering Internships, which is: Dekoruma, Cermati, Tokopedia, Traveloka, and Midtrans, and then the hunting begins.

#### March 29th — Applying to all companies
I visited each company careers page and started sending my resume. Surprisingly, about a couple of hours later, I got an unexpected call from Michaela Nathania, a software engineer from Dekoruma, in which she wanted to schedule an interview with me. We have an agreement to conduct the interview on Friday, 31th March and gladly the interview will be conducted via video call instead of onsite (which is a huge relief since I’m based on Bandung while Dekoruma is based on Jakarta).

#### March 31th — Dekoruma interview
Since this is my first job interview, I got a little nervous. To be honest I’m scared that I will get asked questions which I couldn’t solve and then I will be stuck on an endless loops of “umm..”. I then got connected to a video call with Kak Nia. Before the interview start, Kak Nia told me that the the internship slot is almost full in which many accepted interns are TOKI alumni (Indonesian informatics olympians), and say that I should try my best (pressure = LLONG_MAX).

The interview itself are mostly algorithms questions in which I have to solve the problem on an online document editor while explaining my solution to her. Kak Nia is not an intimidating person and with her supportive nature, I then felt no pressure on solving the problems. There’s a total of 4 questions, ranging from question about stack-queues to question about intervals.

I think I did ok, I managed to solve all of them although I’m still not sure whether my solution is correct or not. Then the interview continues to a friendly talk in which Kak Nia explains to me what Dekoruma is trying to accomplish, its projects, the technologies they used and ITB students that have been accepted to this internship batch. Kak Nia then told me that the result will be announced next Friday which is on April 7th.

#### April 3rd — Rejected by Cermati (Already full)
#### April 3rd— Scheduled interview with Midtrans via online on April 5th
#### Apri 4th — Traveloka online test
The online test was held in Hackerrank, the problem solving question is fairly simple but there’s also questions about OOP (which I know very little of). Gladly, I passed the online test and will be called for interview on 3rd week of April.

#### April 5th — Midtrans Interview
Back when I got called for interview with Midtrans, They said that an interview link for 4pm interview will be sent to my email. But when I check my inbox, there is no email. At first, I thought that maybe the interview will be moved later but at 4.15pm, I randomly check my spam and THERE IT IS, my interview link. When I clicked on it, the video room was empty. I then quickly shoot an email to the HR explaining my circumstances. I then get called by Midtrans Data Science team. The interview itself was pretty casual, it’s only about 20 minutes talking about my side-projects. There’s no info on when I will hear back from them but I guess it was my mistake for not asking.

#### April 7th — Dekoruma internship decision
Today, is the day I got the info whether I got accepted as an intern at Dekoruma or not. When I got home from my lectures, I check my email for info. Still empty, maybe the decision will be sent at night. At about 10pm, I check my email again and its still empty. It’s pretty weird since I was told that whether I get accepted or not, I will be notified, but since there’s 2 hours left, I keep a good faith and keep refreshing my inbox while binge watching on youtube. At 12 AM, there’s still no email. Maybe I just got rejected? I don’t know. But if I was accepted, there should be an email in my inbox. I felt that it was the time to move on and hope that Midtrans and Traveloka will turn out better.

#### April 8th — Unexpected text
At the time, I was on a campus event when I receive this unexpected text from Kak Nia.

#### ***Accepted at Dekoruma!***


YESS!!!, finally after months of learning programming, watching tutorials, and making projects, I finally got a place which I can learn a lot from and contribute to. I then accepted the offer and join Dekoruma as a software engineering intern starting May 29th, which is one of the best decision I have made because I learn so much from it :D

What I learned and My tips
Searching for software engineering internship can be a challenging but rewarding process, here is my tips:

- Prepare well, make sure that you learn necessary material before you apply because if you prepare it well, the process itself can get pretty fast
- Apply early, apply as early as you can, it is recommended to apply 3–4 months before the start date of your internships. Plus, startups usually fill in their internship slot fast.
- Don’t be afraid to apply, no matter how unqualified you may feel, you must always push yourself to try something you’re not ready for, because that is how you grow. It never hurts to try, because whether you’re accepted or not, you will learn a lot from the process itself.
